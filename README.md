## How to play
--------------

The game is based on the clasic Tick-Tac-Toe game. You can read more about the game on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).
In this version, the players are asked to enter their names and the board is printed to the terminal numbered 0-8.
Each player is assigned a mark (x,o) and after each one places a mark on the board, using the keyboard, the turns are changing.
The board keeps the marks of each player and the player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. The game will declare a winner with the statement: "Congratulations {name}, you win".
If no player manages to win, a draw is announced and the game will be over.
